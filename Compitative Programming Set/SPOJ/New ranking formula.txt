We plan to extend the scoring formula for the main SPOJ ranking.

Currently it looks like this:

user's_points = classical + challenge
classical:
= 80/(40+number_of_people_who_have_solved_the_problem) points
challenge:
for the top score in the challenge:
= 3 points
for any lower score in the challenge:
= (user's_score relative_to_the top_score) points

Our suggestion is:

user's_points = classical + challenge + tutorial + partial + publ_contests(?)
classical: (the same as before)
= 80/(40+number_of_people_who_have_solved_the_problem) points
challenge: (the same as before)
for the top score in the challenge:
= 3 points
for any lower score in the challenge:
= (user's_score relative_to_the top_score) points
tutorial:
= 40/(40+number_of_people_who_have_solved_the_problem) points
partial:
= 80/(40+number_of_people_who_have_solved_the_problem) * (percentage_of_solved_test_cases)
publ_contests:
We would like to take public contests into consideration in main ranking. How do you like this idea?
These contests would be Open Contests XXXX, High School Programming League, Olympiad in Informatics, etc.
